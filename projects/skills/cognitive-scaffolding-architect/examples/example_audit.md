2. Students use ChatGPT to "Summarize the themes of Run Melos".
3. Students copy the summary into a report.
4. Students submit the report.

## Output Audit

### 🛡️ Cognitive Audit Report

**Summary**: **CRITICAL RISK**. This lesson encourages total Cognitive Atrophy by bypassing the entire comprehension process.

#### ⚠️ Atrophy Risks (Red Flags)
- **Step 2 (AI Summary)**: Substituting reading comprehension with AI generation.
    - *Risk*: Students lose the ability to **extract structure** from raw text (Abstracting).
- **Step 3 (Copying)**: No processing or verification engaged.
    - *Risk*: **Authority Evasion** (accepting AI as truth) and loss of **Ownership**.

#### 🏗️ Scaffolding Improvements (Interventions)
- **Step 2 (Modified)**: "Write 3 bullet points of what YOU think the theme is *before* asking AI."
    - *Strategy*: **Friction / Prediction**. Forces the brain to create a hypothesis first.
- **Step 3 (Modified)**: "Ask AI to summarize. Then, list 2 differences between YOUR bullets and AI's. Explain WHY they differ."
    - *Strategy*: **Cognitive Mirroring / Verification**. Uses AI as a comparison point, not an answer.
- **New Step**: "Connect one theme to a time YOU felt like Melos."
    - *Strategy*: **Somatic Connection**. Anchors abstract concept in episodic memory.

#### 💡 "Somatic" Check
- [x] Does this lesson force the student to use **episodic memory**? (With improvement)
- [x] Are students required to **evaluate** the tool's output? (With improvement)
